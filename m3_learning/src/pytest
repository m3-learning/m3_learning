usage: conda-env [-h] {create,export,list,remove,update,config} ...

positional arguments:
  {create,export,list,remove,update,config}
    create              Create an environment based on an environment
                        definition file. If using an environment.yml file (the
                        default), you can name the environment in the first
                        line of the file with 'name: envname' or you can
                        specify the environment name in the CLI command using
                        the -n/--name argument. The name specified in the CLI
                        will override the name specified in the
                        environment.yml file. Unless you are in the directory
                        containing the environment definition file, use -f to
                        specify the file path of the environment definition
                        file you want to use.
